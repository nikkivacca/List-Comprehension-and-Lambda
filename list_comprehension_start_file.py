'''List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it. 

Concise way to append somethign from one list to another list

1. expression (transformation)
2.  iteration 
3. condition


list1 = [2,4,8,10,20,30]
list2 = []

for x in list1:
    if (x) >= 10 
        list2.append(x)

VERSUS 

list2= [x for x in list1 if x>=10]

The list comprehension always returns a result list. '''


'''
new_list = []
for i in original_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))  '''

#You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension:

# new_list = [expression(i) for i in original_list if filter(i)]


#The list comprehension starts with a '[' and ']', to help you remember that the
#result is going to be a list.

#There are 3 parts to list comprehension:

#*result*  = [*transform/expression*    *iteration*         *filter*     ]

#The filter part answers the question if the item should be transformed.



## Exercise ##

# 1 Using a list comprehension, create a new list called "newlist" out of the list "numbers", 
# which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]




## 2 create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in
## a sentence except for the word 'the'

sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()



## Given dictionary is consisted of vehicles and their weights in kilograms. 
## Contruct a list of the names of vehicles with weight below 5000 kilograms. 
## In the same list comprehension make the key names all upper case.

dict={"Sedan": 1500, "SUV": 2000, "Pickup": 2500, "Minivan": 1600, "Van": 2400, 
"Semi": 13600, "Bicycle": 7, "Motorcycle": 110}




## Find all the numbers from 1 to 1000 that have a 4 in them



## count how many times the word 'the' appears in the text file - 'sometext.txt'



## Extract the numbers from the following phrase ##

phrase = 'In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending. On average there were 15 reported injuries at each " +
"event, with about 3 or 4 that were classifled as serious per event.'
